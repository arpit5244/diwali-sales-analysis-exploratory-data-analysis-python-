Diwali Sales Analysis is a data-driven project that aims to provide insights into the sales trends of a business during the Diwali festive season. This project involves collecting and analyzing sales data over a specific period of time, with a focus on identifying patterns and trends in customer behavior, product preferences, and sales performance.

The project will use advanced data analysis techniques to uncover correlations and trends in sales data, including sales volume, revenue, customer demographics, and product popularity. These insights can then be used to inform business decisions such as product offerings, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns.

The ultimate goal of this project is to help businesses optimize their sales performance during the Diwali season by providing them with valuable insights into their customer base and sales trends. With this information, businesses can make data-driven decisions that lead to increased sales and revenue.
